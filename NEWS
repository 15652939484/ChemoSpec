##### Version: 1.30
Date: 2009-11-25
News:
Fixed certain .Rd files so the reference manual prints correctly.
Fixed a problem in plotSpectra having to do with the placement of the label if the frequency range was descending.
Removed default xrange in plotSpectra so that users can specify their own xlim via the ... concept.
Added function binData and split trimNbin into removeFreq and binBuck;  in turn, this required adding a check4Gaps function.
Changed sumSpectra to report the number of frequency points, report any gaps in the data, and report the frequency unit/data point correctly.  Also set it up so that users can pass ... arguments.
Added a function to normalize Spectra objects by the sum of each data row (other normalization schemes can be added later).
Added a helper function isWholeNo.
Revised the Spectra object description standard so that unit is only two characters long (NMR = logical was eliminated as it was not used anywhere).
Added and uppdated Rd files.

##### Version: 1.2
Date: 2009-10-14
News:
Added plotScoresG to create ggobi visualizations of the pca results.
Made color schemes consistent with ggobi color schemes.
Clarified and expanded selected documentation files.

##### Version: 1.1
Date: 2009-09-23
News:
Modified colLeaf so that the leaf label size would vary with the number of leaves to be plotted.
Added ... to plot arguments in HCA so that user can pass additional plotting parameters.
Added function plotSpectra which was overlooked in the first build!
Added a description of Spectra objects to the man pages.
Added function plotScores3D to produce simple 3D plots.
Added plotScoresG to create ggobi visualizations of the pca results.
Made color schemes consistent with ggobi color schemes.
Clarified and expanded selected documentation files.
