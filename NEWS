##### Version: 1.40
Date: 2009-12-09
News:
¥ Added the first version of the vignette, which lacks detailed references.
¥ Added man page colorSymbol.Rd to collect all recommendations about color and its use in one place.
¥ Added a function to convert color schemes of an existing Spectra object into a new color scheme (conColScheme).
¥ Expanded the creation and use of Spectra objects to include plotting symbols and alternate plotting symbols for each group, randomly assigned.  These are needed for b/w plots and also for viewing by color-blind individuals.
¥ Fixed an error in how colors and groups were matched up - it was being done differently in different functions.  Function sumGroups now handles this task for consistency.
¥ Updated the help files.
¥ The GitHub site now gets a .tar.gz source file for Mac users, and a .zip file for Windows users.
¥ Also included is a file with installation instructions.

##### Version: 1.31
Date: 2009-11-30
News:
Added function plotScoresRGL which does interactive 3D plots of scores using the rgl package.  This is an alternative to plotScoresG which uses ggobi and rggobi.  Necessitates new dependency on rgl.
Added data set gasNIR.

##### Version: 1.30
Date: 2009-11-25
News:
Fixed certain .Rd files so the reference manual prints correctly.
Fixed a problem in plotSpectra having to do with the placement of the label if the frequency range was descending.
Removed default xrange in plotSpectra so that users can specify their own xlim via the ... concept.
Added function binData and split trimNbin into removeFreq and binBuck;  in turn, this required adding a check4Gaps function.
Changed sumSpectra to report the number of frequency points, report any gaps in the data, and report the frequency unit/data point correctly.  Also set it up so that users can pass ... arguments.
Added a function to normalize Spectra objects by the sum of each data row (other normalization schemes can be added later).
Added a helper function isWholeNo.
Revised the Spectra object description standard so that unit is only two characters long (NMR = logical was eliminated as it was not used anywhere).
Added and uppdated Rd files.

##### Version: 1.2
Date: 2009-10-14
News:
Added plotScoresG to create ggobi visualizations of the pca results.
Made color schemes consistent with ggobi color schemes.
Clarified and expanded selected documentation files.

##### Version: 1.1
Date: 2009-09-23
News:
Modified colLeaf so that the leaf label size would vary with the number of leaves to be plotted.
Added ... to plot arguments in HCA so that user can pass additional plotting parameters.
Added function plotSpectra which was overlooked in the first build!
Added a description of Spectra objects to the man pages.
Added function plotScores3D to produce simple 3D plots.
Added plotScoresG to create ggobi visualizations of the pca results.
Made color schemes consistent with ggobi color schemes.
Clarified and expanded selected documentation files.

##### Version: 1.0
Date: 2009-09-08
