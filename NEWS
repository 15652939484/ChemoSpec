##### Version 1.45
Date:  2010-8-04
News:
¥ No changes; version 1.44 didn't seem to build correctly.

##### Version 1.44
Date:  2010-7-13
News:
¥ When using robPCA with choice "mad" a warning is issued which comes from the latest version of package pcaPP.  It only concerns performance (speed) and may be ignored.
¥ ggobi is on "life support" and hence development of plotScoresG is on hold until ggobi comes back to life or is replaced.  Related to this, some of the color schemes presented in the vignette and discussed in relationship to ggobi appear to have been changed.
¥ Added warnings to specSurvey if there are 1-3 group members, as this makes interpreation of the descriptive statistics tricky.  If there are 3 or fewer group members, the survey results for this group are dropped from the display and a warning is issued.
¥ Made significant changes to removeFreq. There was a problem with how NMR data were handled; this led to a significant re-write.  Everything seems to test out now.
¥ Added two data sets: SrE.IR and SrE.NMR, see the documentation.
¥ Fixed a problem with the subtitle in plotLoadings.
¥ Fixed a few typos of course.
¥ Still 48 functions.

##### Version 1.43
Date:  2009-12-27
News:
¥ A revised version of specSurvey was implemented which permits one to use not only sd, but also sem, iqr and mad to examine the data sets.  In addition, one can look at each group of spectra separately, or analyze the entire data set.
¥ Fixed a axis labeling error in plotScoresRGL & plotScores3D
¥ Fixed an error in getManyCsv in which the entire data matrix in the final Spectra object originated from the first spectrum.  This had been introduced when format = "csv2" was added in 1.42.
¥ 48 functions total

##### Version: 1.42
Date: 2009-12-21
News:
¥ Added optional outlier labeling to plotScoresRGL.
¥ Added robust or classical confidence ellipses as an option to plotScoresRGL and plotScores3D.
¥ Further development of plotScoresG is on hold until rggobi is rebuilt for R 2.10.  When it returns, will add use.sym and confidence ellipses to it.
¥ Added mclustSpectra, a wrapper to mclust methods.
¥ Added mclust3D, a function which permits 3D display of groups identified by mclust.  Either robust or classical confidence ellipses are displayed.  mclust3dSpectra is the front end in the package.
¥ Several support functions added (labelExtremes3d, normVec, makeEllipsoid).
¥ Added a format option "csv2" to getManyCsv for folks in the EU.  Thanks to Richard Pena bringing this to my attention.
¥ Updated all help files.
¥ Expanded vignette.
¥ 43 Functions total

##### Version: 1.41
Date: 2009-12-09
News:
¥ Completed implementation of the use.sym argument to plotting routines which require it.
¥ 36 Functions total.

##### Version: 1.40
Date: 2009-12-09
News:
¥ Added the first version of the vignette, which lacks detailed references.
¥ Added man page colorSymbol.Rd to collect all recommendations about color and its use in one place.
¥ Added a function to convert color schemes of an existing Spectra object into a new color scheme (conColScheme).
¥ Expanded the creation and use of Spectra objects to include plotting symbols and alternate plotting symbols for each group, randomly assigned.  These are needed for b/w plots and also for viewing by color-blind individuals.  The relevant functions now have argument use.sym = FALSE which controls this feature.
¥ Fixed an error in how colors and groups were matched up - it was being done differently in different functions.  Function sumGroups now handles this task for consistency.
¥ Updated the help files.
¥ The GitHub site now gets a .tar.gz source file for Mac users, and a .zip file for Windows users.
¥ Also included is a file with installation instructions.

##### Version: 1.31
Date: 2009-11-30
News:
Added function plotScoresRGL which does interactive 3D plots of scores using the rgl package.  This is an alternative to plotScoresG which uses ggobi and rggobi.  Necessitates new dependency on rgl.
Added data set gasNIR.

##### Version: 1.30
Date: 2009-11-25
News:
Fixed certain .Rd files so the reference manual prints correctly.
Fixed a problem in plotSpectra having to do with the placement of the label if the frequency range was descending.
Removed default xrange in plotSpectra so that users can specify their own xlim via the ... concept.
Added function binData and split trimNbin into removeFreq and binBuck;  in turn, this required adding a check4Gaps function.
Changed sumSpectra to report the number of frequency points, report any gaps in the data, and report the frequency unit/data point correctly.  Also set it up so that users can pass ... arguments.
Added a function to normalize Spectra objects by the sum of each data row (other normalization schemes can be added later).
Added a helper function isWholeNo.
Revised the Spectra object description standard so that unit is only two characters long (NMR = logical was eliminated as it was not used anywhere).
Added and uppdated Rd files.

##### Version: 1.2
Date: 2009-10-14
News:
Added plotScoresG to create ggobi visualizations of the pca results.
Made color schemes consistent with ggobi color schemes.
Clarified and expanded selected documentation files.

##### Version: 1.1
Date: 2009-09-23
News:
Modified colLeaf so that the leaf label size would vary with the number of leaves to be plotted.
Added ... to plot arguments in HCA so that user can pass additional plotting parameters.
Added function plotSpectra which was overlooked in the first build!
Added a description of Spectra objects to the man pages.
Added function plotScores3D to produce simple 3D plots.
Added plotScoresG to create ggobi visualizations of the pca results.
Made color schemes consistent with ggobi color schemes.
Clarified and expanded selected documentation files.

##### Version: 1.0
